# variable: It is a container where you can put value,

Rules for variables name
1. Names can not start with number.
2. Should not have space in between, use _ instead.
3. Don't use those symbols which have other use in python.
4. Always write the names in lowercase.
5. Avoid using those words which have special meaning in python.

'''
Python is dynamically typed language which means you can assign one variables name to different data types.
Ex:
y = 2
y = [1,2,3,4]
Here, y is object of int and also the object of list.

Cons of this is,
You want to print x+y, and you want the input from user and user provided input like this,
x = "2"
y = "3"
then x+y = 23 not 5 which is a con of dynamically type language.

'''

x=2
print(x+3)

#in this example, x is container and 2 is value.

y = 3 # here y is the object of class numbers.
print(x+y)

p = "ram" # here p is the object of class strings.
