#Python is both Interpreted and Compiled language.

'''
compiling: This means conversion of one language into other.
Compiler: This is used to convert one language into other.

'''
#Process
'''
Input gets compiled to give you byte code which get interpreted into machine language which is done by python virtual machine

'''

#Interpreted language because if you have a set of instructions, it will read each and every line one by one and then it will start
# executing executing each line one by one.

# Why it is so complex
''' We use the concept of bite code to reach portability'''
# First you convert into byte code then that byte code can be used in any machine no matter which cpu it has, what all required is python
# virtual machine which interpret this.
