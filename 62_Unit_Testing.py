Unit Testing:
There are several libraries to check your code whether it has bugs or not.
A Few of them are:
1. pylint: This is a library that looks at your code and reports back possible issues.

2. unittest: This built-in library will allow to test your own programs and check you are getting desired outputs.

'''
#pylint:`
'''
1. Pylint  use to check for code for possible errors and styling.
2. Python as a set of style convention rule as PEP8
3. If some spaces are given with tab key and some with space key then it is sign of inaccuracy.
4. It is always better to use space key for spaces rather than tab key.
5. You have to install it by use of 
   pip install pylint
6. Now, open the command prompt, open that folder in command prompt in which your python file is saved which you want to 
   check.
7. After changing the directory, write:
   pylint file_name.py and press Enter it will tell you about all the errors.
8. It also gives score to your python code file.
