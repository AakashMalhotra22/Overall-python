1. type error:                                   1. "type" object is not subscriptable.
                                                 2. It comes when you try to convert string in python to list.
                                                 3. 'set' object is not subscriptable.
                                                     This error comes when you try to do indexing and slicing in set object which is not allowed.
                                                 4. 'int' object is not iterable.
                                                 5. 'tuple' object does not support item assignment.
                                                 6. Complex cant be converted in to other data types.



2. Key Error
                                                 1. It means key does not exist.
                                                 2. Python raises this error whenever a dict() object is requested (using the format a = dict[key])
                                                    and the key is not in the dict.
                                                 3. It generally means you have put the wrong key which does not exist and now python cannot get the value
                                                    for that key from the dictionary.
                                                    Example:
                                                    a = {"name": "ram"}
                                                    print(a[0]) and since 0 is not a key in the dictionary so it will give key word error.

                                                 4. key word error means or comes when you try to call a dictionary object using a key which does not exist.

3. NameError:                                    1. "a" is not defined. ["This means you are using a variable some where in your commands in python which is not defined."]



4. Value Error


5. Attribute Error
