#1.Binary operation

print(bin(25))

# The result of above operation is 0b11001 where 11001 is the output and 0b is the way by which we denote the binary operatinons

print(0b01001011 )

#These all operations gives 5 as output, means 101 = 0101 = 00101
print(0b101)
print(0b0101)
print(0b00101)
print(0b000101)

#2. Octal
print(oct(35))

#Here 0o represents the octal system.

print(0o43)

#3. Hexadecimal

print(hex(10))
print(0xb)
