'''
1. Arithmetic Operators: Simple mathematics operations
2. Assignment Operators: Variable assignment and increment
3. Relational/ Comparision Operators: ==, !=, <,<=,>,>=.
4. Logical Operotors: and, or, not
5. Unary Operators: Multiplication with negative sign.

#1. Arithmetic Operators:
#In this mathematics operations such as addition, sub, division and all the other function in mathematics.
# Example:


x = 3
y=3
print(x+y)

from math import*

print(sqrt(3))
print(round(3.5658764565456546))


#2.Assignment

'''Assignment
x=2 is the example of assignment in which 2 is assigned to x.

'''
x =3
print(x)

x = x+3
print(x)

#Increament

x += 2
print(x)

x *=3
print(x)

a,b = 5,6

print(a,b)
print(a)

#Unary Operators:

n = 7
print(n)

print(-n)

n = -n

print(n)
