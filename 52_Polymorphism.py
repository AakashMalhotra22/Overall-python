Polymorphism:
1. It is made up of poly and morph in which poly means many and morph means forms means many forms.
2. In programming, polymorphism means same function name but different use for different types.
3. For example,
   we human beings are also polymorphic in nature, we behave differently with different people, if we are standing with out friends then we will behave differently, if we are
   talking to our parents then we behave differently, thus on different different conditions we behave differently.

   In the same fashion,
   A function in programming behaves differently when it encounterd with different classes type.


There are four types of polymorphism
1. Duck typing: Method is more important than class type.
2. Operator Overloading: Giving extended meaning to a operator.
3. Method Overloading: Presence of two or more methods with same name in a class.
4. Method Overriding: Method of subclass overrides the method of parent class when the object of sub class is called.
